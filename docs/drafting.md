# Drafting

Pantograph supports drafting from
[Draft-Sketch-Prove](https://github.com/wellecks/ntptutorial/tree/main/partII_dsp).
Pantograph's drafting feature is more powerful. At any place in the proof, you
can replace an expression with `sorry`, and the `sorry` will become a goal.

For an in-depth example, see `experiments/dsp`.
